## Why I found this interesting

In this age of Generative AI being able to write code, compose essays, and paint images in the blink of an eye, there is a question of why should we still be hiring humans? I think of the code it took me hours and days to write a couple years ago, and how I could now arrive at the same or better code within seconds -- not because of a drastic increase in skills, but because I could throw a prompt into ChatGPT and it'll spit out something that works pronto. Human labor is expensive, both in time and money, and if AI can approximate it with a fraction of that cost, it makes me worried about the future of human employment. 

This article highlights something that AI is not yet able to replicate. When AI generates images with minor problems, attempts at using AI to rectify those problems only worsens them. I think that this is, in part, because AI lacks the intent and understanding that humans do. You can include what is wrong in words in the prompt, but the AI, as of now, lacks the real world context and conditioning to understand exactly what is wrong and why it is wrong, which makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what needs to be changed and how it needs to be changed. I believe that in time, we will be able to rectify this issue with AI, but as of now, this meta-understanding that humans have of their projects and the world still give an essential edge over AI. Also the images were funny.


### Comment from Samantha Lin
I'm not yet worried about the future of human employment, but I do agree that the definciences of AI in tweaking generated images will very likely be fixed soon. The article is interesting in that it allows us to see how current AI cannot understand what exactly the objects in an image are, giving us a look into how AI still needs more refining before it can replace human graphics designers or illustrators.
